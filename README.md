# Analytics-Base-Table
Creating an ABT for Data Science class

Using the SWAN-SF Dataset I created an an Analytics Base Table. 
The Data in this dataset is a multi-variate time series that is used to predict solar flare activity.  
For the purposes of this project I will only be examining a small partition of data (around ) and calculating some informaion about some of its features
The final output of calculated features will be in a csv file named 'partition1_features.csv' 

I used jupyer notebook and python to complete this project
